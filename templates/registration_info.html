<h1>How to Register</h1>
<hr style="background:black">


<p>
    Registration is active now! Go to the "courses" dropdown menu, where you will see a list of courses that we offer. To get more information, 
    you can click on the course name, where it will go in detail about the lesson structure, status, and more!
    If the course registration deadline has not passed, you can simply click "Register" at the top of the page, where it will redirect you
    to confirm your selection.</p>

    <p>

    The status represents whether the course has been confirmed. You will not be prompted to pay for the course until it is confirmed by us. 
    The course will only be confirmed if the minimum number of students is 
    met. When the course is confirmed, we will send out an email to everyone detailing the status of the course, where we will send out information about the course as well as payment. If the course quota is not met,
    the class will either be delayed or terminated.

<h1>How to Pay</h1>

    more details about the class. We will confirm you on the website and you should be able to access course materials, including class summaries, video transcripts, and the forum. If you have any questions, please contact us.

    Paid Courses and Registered Courses will show up in the course dropdown. You will be able to see the status of the course if you are registered. If you have paid,
    you will be able to view the course lessons and access the course forum from your course list. We will post lesson summaries in the lesson overview for paid students, and we will answer
    any questions within the dedicated forum. Students are encouraged to answer other students' questions! Information about classes will be emailed before each lesson, along
    with any information required.
