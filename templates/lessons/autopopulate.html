<h1>Autopopulate Form</h1>
<p class="lead">This will automatically generate a number of lessons so you don't have to do it manually. Only you and I can see this page.
    It will redirect you to the list, and it autopopulates a bunch of stuff for the lessons related to each class. Up to 50 lessons, but that
    is much more than you actually need. Use it modestly :).

<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form|crispy }}
    <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Autopopulate!</button>
</form>
