    <h1>New Comment</h1>
    <p>Posting comment under the user with email {{ request.user.email }}.</p>
    <p>A new commenting system will be added so that you don't have to come to 
    a new page to enter a comment. The implementation is challenging (uses AJAX, if you're interested) and has not been figured out yet. Stay tuned!</p>
